# Original model by Michelle Sims:
# Model 2: Model with random effects for slope and intercept and latitude quadratic plus 
# overdispersion - this time I did log distance
# adjusted model  - now computes residuals and computes bayesian p-value using deviance

# converted to run in JAGS - TE
# Random effects for slope and intercept and takes 1 covariate. 

# 2020-03-10
# 2020-09-17 Changed to 2 slope model
